### 7. Force

Some contracts will simply not take your money ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The goal of this level is to make the balance of the contract greater than zero.

  Things that might help:

- Fallback methods

- Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.

- See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"

```
await getBalance(contract.address)
'0'
contract.address
'0x58dc2d03B86410ed60cCdD453E568f3198EBAc7a'

//ether送金完了

await getBalance(contract.address)
'1'
```


In solidity, for a contract to be able to receive ether, the fallback function must be marked payable.

However, there is no way to stop an attacker from sending ether to a contract by self destroying. 

Hence, it is important not to count on the invariant address(this).balance == 0 for any contract logic.
