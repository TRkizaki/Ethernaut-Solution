### 10. Re-Entrancy

The goal of this level is for you to steal all the funds from the contract.

  Things that might help:

- Untrusted contracts can execute code where you least expect it.

- Fallback methods

- Throw/revert bubbling

Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.<br>

//A re-Entrancy atttack occurs when you write a function in your contract that makes an external function call to another untrusted contract.

// before your function call is able to completely executing and resolve any kind of effects.

//you're calling or you're potentially calling contract that's untrusted, they can take control of your calling function in your contract 

//and make a recursive call that creates a loop with very unfortunate and very unintended consequences

we are now recommended that transfer() and send() be avoided.

/how prevent this attack ever happning //38:23

//mutex
```
mutex is something that places a lock on some contract state and only the owner of that lock can modify the state 
and the idea is that you basically lock a contract while a function is being executed.
and that ensures that only a single function can be executed at a time.
mutex would basically be an internal mechanism.we would track of that would of piece of state in our case our balances 
is only being modified while a function is getting executed once that only single function executed at a time

*Flaw

Check > Interact > Effect(wrong order) - leads to re-entrancy flaw 

Externally owned account (EOA)... 

*Assumption => Baked in assumption that we are going to interact with an EOA. but in the real-world contracts a fair game too. 

Fallbacks... We are going to "fallback" into the target over and over, until we remove all the funds.

 mutex (mutual exclusion object)

 a program object that is created so that multiple program thread can take turns sharing the same resource, such as access to a file.

In order to prevent re-entrancy attacks when moving funds out of your contract, 
use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern being aware that call will only return false without interrupting the execution flow. <br>
Solutions such as ReentrancyGuard or PullPayment can also be used.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/utils#ReentrancyGuard
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/payment#PullPayment

transfer and send are no longer recommended solutions as they can potentially break contracts after the Istanbul hard fork Source 1 Source 2.
https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/reentrancy-after-istanbul/1742

Always assume that the receiver of the funds you are sending can be another contract, 
not just a regular address. Hence, it can execute code in its payable fallback method and re-enter your contract, 
possibly messing up your state/logic.

Re-entrancy is a common attack. You should always be prepared for it!
