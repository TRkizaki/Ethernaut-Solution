6. DELEGATION 

This means that a contract can dynamically load code from a different address at runtime. 
Storage, current address and balance still refer to the calling contract, 
only the code is taken from the called address.

The goal of this level is for you to claim ownership of the instance you are given.

  Things that might help

●Look into Soliditys documentation on the delegatecall low level function, how it works, 
how it can be used to delegate operations to on-chain libraries, and what implications it has on execution scope.
●Fallback methods

=> hackingに成功 via pwn()function


Usage of delegatecall is particularly risky and has been used as an attack vector on multiple historic hacks. With it, 
your contract is practically saying "here, -other contract- or -other library-, do whatever you want with my state". 
Delegates have complete access to your contracts state. The delegatecall function is a powerful feature, 
but a dangerous one, and must be used with extreme care.
